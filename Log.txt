Current State of Phase 1:

IR and PIR clients:
-	Delay that caused light counter to freeze has been removed
-	Error loading default values have been removed
-	Added limiters to block wrong values from being sent to the server
-	Hardware error that caused the pir sensor to not work was fixed: bad wire connection. Also, when reconnecting wires to the board, best practice to connect ground wire first

Client Emulator:
-	No changes
-	Just a simple tcp client made to test the server’s acceptance of new clients

SysMonitor:
-	Zone sync not yet implemented
-	Works fine with two clients
-	Problem that caused the application to consume >50% processor resources has been removed (must always use thread. Sleep)
-	Problem that freezes DataGrid when amount of data is greater than the limit still needs to be fixed
-	GraphViewer still has to be implemented

Phase (Phase 2) Changes: Yet to Implement

-	Implement Zone Sync
-	Implement Database Connection
-	Resolve DataGrid freeze
-	Implement Zone monitor window

Phase 3: Yet to Implement

-	Connect Clients to Cloud
-	Create a online webpage using node-red for management of clients to prove system scalability
